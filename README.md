Module 14 Challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

* The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
5. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
6. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file
